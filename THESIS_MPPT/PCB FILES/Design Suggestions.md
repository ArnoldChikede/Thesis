Design A PCB Board Prototype with the following things to consider 



* Temperature sensor incorporated...will check also if things kike humidity are  required
* Wifi and cloud capabilities 
* Led Display (Still yet to decide which one to use)
* Boost converter circuit Obviously 
* Probably a four layer board(With bottom and top as ground poured for shielding)
* Consider  heat sinks for cooling also
