Design A PCB Board Prototype with the following things to consider



* Temperature sensor incorporated...will also check if things kike humidity are  required
* Wifi and cloud capabilities (Covered under the esp32 chip) ---actually THE WIFI pART IS MORE OR LESS Set-Up
* Led Display (Still yet to decide which one to use) --ILI9341 (2.4–2.8″) ,ILI9488 (3.5″) 
* Boost converter circuit Obviously
* Probably a four-layer board(With bottom and top as ground poured for shielding)
* Consider  heat sinks for cooling also
