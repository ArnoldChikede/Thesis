### THESIS



**NOV 19**



First page for the thesis

* Topic
* name of supervisor



**Outline should be the same as the thesis**



ss

##### **BODY**



* Explain why I chose the topic first of all



* With that, explain why I chose the boost converter over other topologies



* Explain the Idea behind the MPPT project

1.  How solar systems work
2.  Mppt  idea   (Also check if the MPPT can be applied in different renewable energy cases, if so, that's its adaptability in different technologies)





##### **Process workflow**



* Outline the steps that are to be followed and explanations, LIKE WHAT WILL BE HAPPENING AT EACH AND EVERY STEP!



* We shall explicitly explain the stages of the project mentioned in the above step.



* List what you have done so far



* **list what's left from where you are now**



* The problems with this project

1.  being  how hard it is to get similar results from hardware after simulations
2.  problem in manufacturing hardware, one mistake costs if it's being done incorrectly but however, that can be having prototypes first but still a correct prototype is better than a failed one, coz you move to the next step in case of success



* Show case if there is any difference between  already made solar MPPT systems and what I'm willing to make more, like why would someone choose your project lets say



* Include the estimate of the cost of the project

1. Include also how economic this(check if the esp32 can work for longer ours maybe leaving it to run for longer hours with some crazy logic running)



* You can also put future improvements for cases when you have time!!



#### 

#### Technical Problems mentioned by the teacher

* Use larger fonts
* Less pictures and more information
* If we use pictures use the ones that show  or illustrate the whole thingy
* Do not use longer slides
* Outline at first where you put the main issues you will be talking about
* Try to explain the WHY for different cases say why did you choose the esp32
