As we can realize here, we implement soft switching and we eliminate the high inrush currents that we have at the beginning of the simulation 
The reason why we  have such Inrush currents are,
At first the circuit starts from zero  so all the elements are dead, thus the inductor and the output capacitor
So the problem here is that they try to draw too much from the circuit at startup, so as they charge up
We see that the problem can be solved pretty nicely by using a soft start method
We gradually increase the duty cycle, ramping it up until we reach the preferred duty cycle for the certain Operating Point we would be at
